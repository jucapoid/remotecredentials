# remotecredentials
A go project to create and manage credentials with a postgresql database and a simple http web server for usage in browser

For now we have imported an old project to do the credential generation

Also would a cups client service be usefull for printing(actual printing in paper)?

# To use the server
#### `go run simple.go`
or
#### `go build simple.go; ./simple.`
(first dosent save the compiled file, unlike the second)

And go to 
#### `127.0.0.1:9090`
